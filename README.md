# Shoe Store Manager App

This app is a shoe store manager that allows you to manage the shoe inventory by performing all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app uses an API to retrieve the shoe data, and you can update or delete the data as needed.

## Technologies Used

- React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- React Router DOM: a library that allows for client-side routing in a React application.
- Styled Components: a library that allows you to write CSS in your JavaScript code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/shoe-store-manager.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
cd shoe-store-manager
npm install
```

3. Run the app:

```
npm start

This should open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
